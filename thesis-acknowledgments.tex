\noindent
First, I am grateful to Prof. Michael Kaess, my advisor for his patience, guidance and belief in me over the past two years through thick and thin! Without his support and ideas through our discussions, notwithstanding funding, this work would not have been possible. I would like to thank Prof. Katerina Fragkiadaki, for her guidance through the third semester about deep learning, and impressing the need to stay up-to-date  with the research literature, and providing avenues to hone my learning.

Next, I would like to thank Wei Dong for being foremost a friend, a supportive co-author and for the insightful research discussions, that significantly influenced this work. I am thankful to my colleagues and former labmates in the Robot Perception lab (RPL) for their encouragement, honest research feedback and comments. I have learned a lot from them, and they made work at CMU an enjoyable experience.
